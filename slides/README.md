# OpenGL and Khronos Standards (Part 1)


# OpenGL Geometry and Tessellation (Part 2)

This part of the workshop covers the newer programmable stages in the OpenGL pipeline. The unique capabilities of these stages make them useful for a range of visualisation techniques. We will work from the ground up, starting with a "Hello Quad" example, towards increasingly more complex scenes, introducing various GLSL features along the way.
